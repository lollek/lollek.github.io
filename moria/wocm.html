# Moria Farming with Wand of Clone Monster
## Requirements

To farm with a wand of clone monster, you need  

1. A wand of clone monster
2. A monster with good drops
3. (optional) A way to refresh your wand

As always in moria, things can go wrong. It would be stupid to not carry an
escape mechanism like a scroll of teleportation.

### Wand of Clone Monster
The wand begins dropping on 750ft, and is therefore best aquired there. It's not
that rare though, so you will probably find a few every once in a while.

### A monster with good drops
- **Gelatinous Cube** (2-6 items, spawns on 800+ft)  
Best monster to farm without danger, since it moves a bit erratically at half speed, and drops a lot of items.  Don't get hit, as they ruin your armor. They destroy items they
step on. They can also merge with each other, which wastes your wand charges.
- **Guardian Naga** (1-3 items, spawns on 750+ft)  
Good monster if you're careful. They move at normal speed, but a bit
erratically, so they can be easily baited. They destroy items they step on.
Since they cannot merge, you will probably get more items per wand charge than
from gelatinous cubes.

### A way to refresh your wand
Mages (and classes with mage spells) can recharge wands through spells. It's
also possible to buy scrolls or recharging from the shop.

## Farming with a wand of clone monster
The safest way to farm is by using pillars. Either find a appropriate pillar or
create one with stone-to-mud. A good example is something like this

    #............#
    #.....@......#
    #.##########.#
    #............#
    ............##

It is preferable to have it at least 4-5 tiles long, so you can move a little
bit without baiting monsters. You will want to get a monster to the edge of the
pillar, clone it, then move to the middle. This will cause one monster to follow
you, and another to become stuck on the opposite side of the wall. Example:

    Position monster  Clone it          Bait it
    #............#    #............#    #............#
    #............#    #n...........#    #....n.......#
    #n##########.# -> #n##########.# -> #.##########.#
    #.@..........#    #.@..........#    #....n@......#
    ............##    ............##    ............##

Then you kill the monster and repeat. Don't forget to recharge wands, rest and eat.
