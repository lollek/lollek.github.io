Introduction:

Once upon a time, there was a game called moria.  It was a pretty good game,
and a lot of people really enjoyed playing it.  As time went by, more people
suggested changes to the game, adding more items, more monsters, and more ways
to die.  This resulted in a difficult game to win.

As more time went by, news groups were created out of the murk with names like
rec.games.moria where people could gloat over their victories and provide
hints and answers to questions that the ignorant masses posed.  However, once
a question was asked and answered, the piece of advice was lost forever and
would often be reasked in a matter of weeks.

Within this file is a large collection of lore about the game of Moria.  Some
of it may not be true, but I have made the best effort possible to verify all
of the information contained herein.  Much of it has been verified, corrected,
or added since the start of editing of this document before it was ever posted
to the network.

Also, we would like to request that any corrections, modifications, 
suggestions, etc.  be E-mailed directly to mrmarcel@eos.ncsu.edu and not
posted to the net.  We will attempt to verify any information sent us and then
we will both add it to the spoiler file (for the next release) and post an
official correction/addition to rec.games.moria.

Note:  Please do not send E-mail to us asking for a copy of Moria itself (or 
the source code, etc).  We do not honor these requests, and often just ignore 
them.

Be warned:  If you use the knowledge contained herein, your game will never be
the same.  Your horizons will suddenly be expanded, but you may end up
thinking that the game is less than it once was.  That is the risk you must
take if you choose to read ths file.

Good luck, and happy adventuring!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Revision History:

In order to keep a decent idea of how the spoiler file is progressing, we have
set up an official policy on how Revision Numbers will change.  Any minor
revisions, corrections, or amplifications will advance the revision number
by .01.  New sections added, or complete re-writes of existing sections will
advance the revision number of .10.  Any complete rewrite of the entire file
(just in case - it might actually happen) will advance the revision number to
the next integer.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Credits:

Well, this should actually be a very large list.  Among others, it should
include almost everyone who has posted any hints of value to the net within
about the last decade.  Some people who have made contributions to the cause
of these spoilers above and beyond the call of duty, however, are listed here:

    Michael Beresis
    Sharon L. Casteel
    William Chuang
    Aaron M. Clements
    James Frye
    David Grabiner
    Maarten Hazewinkel
    Ben Hodson
    Jeremy Seip
    Kevin Souter
    John Vessey
    Nicholas C. Weaver
    io20084@maine.maine.edu
    petitc@rpi.edu

If any of the rest of you out there know you contributed something to the
cause, but don't see your name listed here - don't get us wrong.  It's not
that we're ungrateful!  We probably just nuked your name by mistake!

Note:  All names are listed in alphabetical order by last name, and not by
order of importance of contribution.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Using The Spoilers:

There's really not much to say on this subject, other than a few intuitive
pointers.  How you use the spoilers is simple:  You read them, and apply the
knowledge contained within to your game of moria.

The section titles tend to be fairly unique, and are always followed by a
colon.  This should make it very simple to get to whatever section you want
quickly.  Just load the file into your editor (or if you're on a unix system,
even use 'more' for that matter), and use the search function to look for the
section.  For instance, from within more or vi, use the slash key ("/") and
what you'd like to search for ("Armor:" for example)>

This technique is also very useful for finding every reference to a particular
topic.  If you'd like to know about speed in moria, just search for every
occurance of the word "speed" in the file.

Moria Versions:

There are many versions of moria.  The most current is version 5.5.2  This
spoiler file is based in the workings of Moria 5.x.  All of the Moria 5.x
play similarly.

If you are playing version 4.87, then may of the scribblings in this file
will be incorrect for you, and you can either deal with it or upgrade to
the 5x version.  See the FAQ questions for more details, or the Versions
file that comes with moria for a more complete history.

Frequently Asked Questions:

Most of these questions are culled from the FAQ which is posted to
rec.games.moria twice a month.  Other questions come from questions that 
experts are tired of answering in the newsgroup or questions that I get asked
by players in the dorm.  Many more questions that are in the FAQ not
related to spoilers have been removed.

Most common questions:

Q:  How does speed work?  Do you get faster if you are already "Very Fast" 
and get another speed item?

A:  Very Fast is the highest speed that can be displayed, but if you are
fortunate enough to find several speed items, you can get still faster.
Permanent speed items (rings and boots) are cumulative, and temporary
speed (potions, spells, and staffs) can add one more point to your
speed.  Multiple uses of temporary speed are cumulative only in
duration.

Q:  I'm playing Moria version 5; how does that compare to the current version?
Is it compatible?
Moria versions:

A:  Umoria 5.5.2: This is the current version of Umoria.  It will accept
characters from all Umoria 5.x versions.

Umoria 5.3.1/5.4.0: These are essentially identical to 5.5.0, and
compatible with it, although 5.5.0 fixes a few bugs, and there have been
a few minor changes.

Umoria 5.2.2/5.3.0: These are in good condition, and compatible with the
current version.  One bug: don't rest more than 10,000 turns in place,
and leave the level if you start seeing lots of "Compacting monsters..."
messages, or the game may lock up.

Umoria 5.2.1: This is playable, but has no high scores file; you
probably want to upgrade if possible.

Umoria 5.1.0-5.2.0: These versions can be played, but are somewhat
buggy.  If you run into an invisible, invincible monster which doesn't
move or attack, get off the level.  If you can FTP the sources or
executables, you should upgrade.

The U is often omitted from the names of the following Umoria versions.

Umoria 4.87/PC-Moria 4.87x: This version is based on the old VMS Moria.
It is relatively bug-free, but it doesn't have the features of the 5.x
versions, such as monster memory.  The save file format is incompatible
with 5.x, and several people have failed in attempts to write a
conversion program.

Umoria 4.85: A moderately buggy version, also based on VMS Moria.

Umoria/PC-Moria 4.83: An extremely buggy version, based on VMS Moria.
This version is essentially unplayable (see invisible doesn't work,
stores all close after 32768 turns, etc.)

The following versions are not compatible with Umoria, and Umoria
spoiler files may not apply to them.  I don't know much about these
versions.

UB Moria 5.0: Also known as VMS Moria 5.0, this is the current version
of VMS Moria.  It has more monsters, a Black Market, and other features.

Imoria 4.9: This is apparently a very good game, with new character
classes and other features, but it hasn't been released outside of UW.

Amiga Moria 3.0: Although this version was originally based on 4.85, it
has many added monsters, features, and bugs (including items which make
you virtually invincible).

BOSS: This game changes the setting of Moria, but keeps many of the
items.  It is based on VMS Moria 5.0.

Q:  How do you kill an ancient multi-hued dragon?

A:  Usually, you don't want to try; one gas breath from a full-strength AMHD
    does 693 damage, with no resistance.

    If you can get to speed 3 (one permanent speed item, and either another
    permanent speed item or a haste self spell or staff), you can try this
    technique.  First create (or find in a maze room) a wall with one open
    space on all four sides.

        .
       .#.
        .

    Stand on one side, with the dragon on the other side.  when the dragon
    moves adjacent to you,  attack it once, and then hide behind the pillar.
    The dragon can't see you, so it won't breathe, and will instead chase you
    to another side.  Now attack once, and hide again, and so on until the
    dragon is finished.

Q:  How do you kill an emperor lich?

A:  You can kill an emperor lich if you can get to speed 2, which is its
speed.  A mage or ranger can do this with the spell of haste self;
anyone else needs a staff of speed, potion of haste self, or permanent
speed item.  You will also need about 10 cure critical wounds or cure
serious wounds potions, and some item giving you free action.

You also need some ranged spell attack.  Liches take double damage from
lightning in 5.x versions, so the spell of lightning bolt or wand of
lightning balls is a good choice.  Rogues and warriors will need several
wands, with a total of about 30 charges to guarantee that they can kill
the lich with them.  A priest or paladin has Orb of Draining, which is
even better.

Now, try to line up with the lich while you are not adjacent to it,
either in a room or a corridor.  This gives you a chance to cast your
spell.  The lich will get one action.  If it cast a spell and you
resisted, or the spell didn't do anything harmful, you have another
chance.  If you were confused or blinded, drink a cure wounds potion;
the lich isn't adjacent to you, so it can't hurt you.  If the lich moved
and is now adjacent to you, move back.  Try to avoid getting cornered,
and phase door or portal away if you are.  A priest can make this easier
by putting down a glyph of warding, but this must be done *before* the
lich chases you across the glyph.  (Don't stand on the glyph; it isn't
foolproof.)

If you run low on mana and don't have a wand, teleport out and come back
later to finish the job.

A priest with glyph of warding can also set up the following
configuration (the exact length doesn't matter as long as you are within
spell range):

#L#####
#^^...@
#######

The lich cannot cast spells from this position, because it cannot see
you.  As long as it doesn't break the glyphs, you are safe, and can fire
Orb of Draining down the corridor; the lich will take some damage each
time.  If the lich breaks either glyph, run or teleport out, and
continue the battle elsewhere.

I do not advise trying this technique against an AMHD; it will probably
break a glyph before the battle is over, and if your teleport spell
fails, or if you haven't hasted yourself, the AMHD gets a chance to
breathe.
If you can get to speed 2, you can engage AMHDs by excavating one
of the x's, and stepping back into that place when the AMHD breaks
through. That gives you time to teleport safely.

An emperor lich has 1520 hit points, plus anything additional that it
gains by draining mana (6 points per mana point drained) and charges (40
points per charge).  Never let it attack you in melee, because it can
destroy your wands, healing itself in the process, as well as draining
your experience and dexterity.

If you can get to speed 3, faster than the lich, it is easy to kill;
just fight, move back, fight, move back, and so on.  You will still need
a lot of cure wounds potions, unless you let it chase you around a
pillar, as in the AMHD technique.


Q:  What is the Grape Jelly trick?  Does it work anymore?

A:  The Grape Jelly trick is a spoiler/workaround/trick which is no longer
necessary in 5.1 and later versions.

In old versions, when any of your stats changed, things like HP and Mana would
not.  Thus, to get the benifit, you used a grape jelly (or any other level
drainer, but jellys are the safest) to drain you to a low level and use restore
life levels to go back up to the increased stats.

In modern versions, items are automatically changed, and when you're drained
you are restored with exactly the same attribs as you had before.

----------------------------| Character |-------------------------------------
                            -------------

Attributes:

Moria characters have several attributes that affect how they their character
can survive in the dungeon and interact with monsters.  Many of these have
cryptic relationships to their actual function.  Below is a list of all the
attributes and their contribution to the character.
The following six attributes, which are the most important, are on a scale
of 3-18, with an additional 'exceptional' value after 18, designated by
a slash, like 18/29.  The maximum value of any attribute is 18/100.  A plain
18 is the same as 18/00.  If a second number is displayed next to the
attribute (like STR:    18  18/29) the second number is your original
value before it was drained by a attribute draining creature.

STR:  Character strength.

+-------------------------------------------+   Carry capacity is:
|  STR Range   | +HIT bonus | +Damage bonus |   
+-------------------------------------------+
|  3           |     -3     |      -2       |   STR * 13.0 + Weight
|  4           |     -2     |      -1       |
|  5   - 7     |     -1     |       0       |   Maximum of 300.0 lbs.
|  8   -15     |      0     |       0       |
| 16           |     +0     |      +1       |   Weapon limit
| 17           |     +0     |      +2       |
| 18   -18/74  |     +1     |      +3       |   STR * 1.5 < Weapon Wt.
| 18/75-18/90  |     +2     |      +4       |   then hit it str*1.5-wt
| 18/91-18/99  |     +3     |      +5       |
| 18/100       |     +4     |      +6       |
+-------------------------------------------+

DEX:  Character Dexterity and Agility:

|  DEX Range   | +HIT bonus | +AC Bonus | +Disarm Bonus |

|  3           |     -3     |    -4     |      -8       |

|  7           |     -1     |     0     |      -1       |
|  8   -12     |      0     |     0     |       0       |

| 16           |     +1     |    +1     |      +2       |
| 17           |     +2     |    +1     |      +2       |
| 18   -18/49  |     +3     |    +2     |      +4       |
| 18/50-18/90  |     +4     |    +3     |      +5       |
| 18/91-18/99  |     +4     |    +4     |      +6       |
| 18/100       |     +5     |    +5     |      +8       |
+-------------------------------------------------------+

The number of attacks/round it determined by the weight of the weapon, the
STR, and DEX attributes.  S/W = Str divided by the weight of the weapon in
pounds.  Exceptional strength, is added to the 18.  (18/29 = 47)

+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

INT and WIS:  These determine your spell casting ability.  For Mages, Rangers
and Rogues, use the INT stat, and for priests and paladins, use the WIS stat.

Also, INT gives you a bonus for using devices, as shown in the table below.
Note:  This is for the INT stat, no matter what the class is.  See the wand
and staff section for a complete formula for the chance to use a device
sucessfully.

Classes:

There are six classes in Moria.  The Warrior, Mage, Priest, Rogue, Ranger, and
Paladin.  All of these classes get modifiers on their stats at the beginning
and develop skills at a different rate per level.  All but the warrior also
gets spells.  These spells are described in the Spells section at the end of
this file.

Experience:

All characters receive experience during the game.  Experience
determines your level, which determines hit points, mana points,
spells, abilities, etc.  The amount of experience required to 
advance a level is a base value (shown below) plus a penalty
for race and class.

Base Experience

|  9 |    380       | 22 |   8,400      | 35 |    500,000  |
| 10 |    500       | 23 |  10,200      | 36 |    750,000  |

| 13 |  1,100       | 26 |  25,000      | 39 |  5,000,000  |
+----------------------------------------------------------+

Maximum level is 40 and maximum experience is 9,999,999

There are penalties to experience to help balance out the classes and
races.  These are listed above and are used to figure out your actual
experience required.

For example:  For a 10'th level Gnomish Mage to achieve 11'th level
needs:
           500 *  1.25 * 1.30 = 812.5
         (base) (gnome) (mage)

Note:  Even for the worst case (Gnomish Ranger) it is still possible
to achieve the 40th level.  (5,000,000*1.25*1.40=8,750,000 experience)
(Note:  A Gnomish Ranger can't exist, this was just a worst cast scenario)

The program internally keeps experience out to the second decimal place
even though it only displays the integer portion on the screen.

There are many ways to gain experience.  This list shows a few.

1.  Defeating monsters
2.  Disarming traps
3.  Picking locks
4.  Using a scroll, potion, staff, wand, or rod for the first time
      and discovering what it did.
5.  Casting a spell successfully for the first time.
6.  Drinking a potion of gain experience

Identifying objects will give (item level + char level/2) /char level 
experience points.

Each experience level has a title which is displayed under your name
and class.  Below is a listing of all the titles for each level and
class.

The City:

The city is a special part of the game of moria.  You start the game here.  
Unlike other levels of the dungeon, the town is only one screen big and it has
stores that will buy and sell items you find in the store.  There are monsters
on this level, but since it is assumed that you grew up in an environment like
this, you will get zero experience points for killing town creatures.

Stores:

There are six kinds of stores on the town level:

   General stores:  sell food, water, cloaks, picks, light sources, and spikes
   Weapon shop:  sells weapons
   Armor shop: sells armor
   Temple:  Sells potion, scrolls, prayer books, and some bashing weapons
   Alchemists shop:  Sells potions, scrolls
   Magic shop:  Sells magic books, wands, staffs, rings, amulets

Each store can have a different shopkeeper that will determine base prices, 
haggling difficulty, and overall pleasantness.

Insult:  The number of times you can insult the shopkeeper before he kicks you
         out of his store.

Haggling:

Haggling is one of the most irritating skills in the game, according to most
people.  There are been methods of eliminating haggling, or making it an option
in the game.  Here is a detailed method of how to haggle and get the best price
on an item.

Final offer price

             Base cost of item
           * Final offer markup
           * Race adjustment
           * CHA adjustment
          --- Final offer price

The initial offer price is the same, except substitute the First instead of 
Final in the second line.

If the item is unidentified, the price is determined by the table below.  Using
the real price would allow players to identify the relative value of items by
offering to sell them.

+---------------------------+
| Unidentified Item | Price |
+---------------------------+
| Weapon or Armor   |  Base |
| Diggers           |  Base |
| Food              |     1 |
| Potion            |    20 |
| Scrolls           |    20 |
| Amulet            |    45 |
| Ring              |    45 |
| Wand              |    50 |
| Staff             |    70 |
+---------------------------+

If a wand or staff whose type is known, but not the number of charges, the base
price for the wand/staff is used.

If a non-cursed type of ring or amulet is known, but not the bonus, then the
price is still the base price of the ring/amulet

Ration type foods are always identified.  Only molds and mushrooms are above.

Race adjustment is how well members of two races get along.  The table below
is the percent markup based on the race of the player and the shopkeeper.

+----------------Shopkeeper Race-------------------------------------------+
| Player  | Human | H-Elf | Elf | H-ling | Gnome | Dwarf | H-Orc | H-Troll |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Human   |  100  |  105  | 105 |   110  |  113  |  115  |  120  |   125   |
| Half-Elf|  110  |  100  | 100 |   105  |  110  |  120  |  125  |   130   |
| Elf     |  110  |  105  | 100 |   105  |  110  |  120  |  125  |   130   |
| Halfling|  115  |  110  | 105 |    95  |  105  |  110  |  115  |   130   |
| Gnome   |  115  |  115  | 110 |   105  |   95  |  110  |  115  |   130   |
| Dwarf   |  115  |  120  | 120 |   110  |  110  |   95  |  125  |   135   |
| Half-Orc|  115  |  120  | 125 |   115  |  115  |  130  |  110  |   115   |
| Half-Trl|  110  |  115  | 115 |   110  |  110  |  130  |  110  |   110   |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

When offering a price, if you didn't increase (decrease for selling) you offer 
by the Haggle% of the shopkeeper, he is insulted.  If you have insulted him
the number of times in the Insult column, he closes his store for 1000 turns.
If you increase it by more than 3*Haggle%, then instead of the shopkeeper 
matching your change, he'll just use 3*Haggle%.  Thus you have just given the
shopkeeper some free money.

If the number of good haggles - 3* bad haggles - 5 is greater than zero and
it's square is greater than the price/50, haggling is not necessary for that
item.

The Underground:

Each level of the underground is filled with rooms,  monsters, and treasure.
These levels are much bigger than the town level, typically 66 high and 198
characters wide.  When you pass through a stair, the old level is destroyed
and a new one created.  There will not be a staircase for you to return to the
old level, after going through a staircase.  You will have to find one on the
level.

Traps:

There are many traps to be found in the dungeons.  Some of these traps are
just natural occurances, but others are set by monsters to try and kill the
adventurer.

Notice is the number of turns he will sleep - distance from you when the sleep
count starts.  For every three points of stealth you have, the sleep time is
doubled.  Also, if you attack, that wakes the monster up.

The experience given above is for a character the same level as the monster.
To convert this to a different level:

        (base exp)*(monster level)
        --------------------------  = real experience
               (char level)

Hence the Balrog for a 40th level character would be worth:

        55000*100
        --------- = 137500 experience points
           40

Monster Attacks:

   ATCK  No special attack, just damage

   LIGT  Lightning based attack.
   CORR  Corrosion attack
   BLND  Blinds character
   PARA  Paralyzes character

Hit Probability:

       Hit bonus on weapon
     + Hit bonus on items
     + Hit bonus for DEX
     + Hit bonus for STR
     * 3
     + Fighting ability (or Bow ability for missiles)
   ----
       Total to hit bonus.

A random number between 1 and that hit number must be greater than the
monster's AC.  In addition, a 1d20 is rolled.  A 1 on this die forces a miss
and a 20 forces a hit.

Critical hits:
       Hit bonus on weapon
     + Hit bonus on items
     + Hit bonus for DEX
     + Hit bonus for STR
     * 5
     + Fighting ability
     + Weight of weapon*10
     - Fighting ability at 0th level.
   ---
       Total chance to critical

If a number between 1 and 5000 is less than the critical chance, you have 
scored a critical hit. 

Damage Calculation:

Assuming you hit, the damage calculation is relatively straight-forward.

        Damage of weapon
      * EGO Bonus
      * Critical hit bonus
      + To Dam Bonus on weapon
      + To Dam Bonus on items
      + To Dam Bonus from STR
     ---
        Total damage

If you scored a critical hit, the bonus is calculated below:
 
       Weight of weapon
     * 10
     + Random number between 1 and 650
    ---
       Severity level

+-------------------------------+
| Severity | Multiplier         |
+-------------------------------+
|    0-399 |  2x+5  (good)      |
|  400-699 |  3x+10 (excellent) |
|  700-899 |  4x+15 (superb)    |
|  900+    |  5x+20 (*GREAT*)   |
+-------------------------------+

Bashing:

The chance of bashing a monster is significantly lower than hitting it
with a weapon, even your fists.

        Bonus to hit on STR
      + Weight of shield*5
      + Weight of player/10
     ---
        Chance to hit.

You check to hit as above, but the chance for critical hits uses the weight of
the shield/4 as the weapon wieght above.  Damage is the calculated the same
with the damage caused being 1d1 or 1d2 depending on the shield.  Also, an
additional bonus of character weight/60 +3 is added due to the force of your
body ramming into whatever you hit.

The usefulness of basing is the chance to stun an oppenant.  This has the
effect of a paralyze for 1d3 turns.  If 100+2d400 > HP+AverageHP then
the monster is stunned.  Note:  The Balrog can never be stunned.

If 1d150 > your dexterity (exceptional added to rest, so 18/29=47) then you are
stunned for 1+1d2 rounds.

AC Calculation:

         Sum of Armor AC
       + Bonus on AC
       + Bonus on Items
       + Bonus from DEX
       + Bonus from spells (Bless, etc)
      ---
         Total AC.

Simple enough, wasn't it...

                                  -------------
----------------------------------| The Items |---------------------------------
                                  -------------

Following is a complete description of every item in the game.  Note that 
it is difficult to identify any of the items without just trying them out.

The Perception skill will allow you to notice magical armor and weapons.  They
will appear as {magik} and you will get a message about something in your
pack or something that you're wearing/wielding.

The names (like metalic green potion, and scroll named "xj dsy") are generated
differently every time, but in the same game of Moria will always represent the
same object.

Items preceded by an * are always damned.  Any item with a negative enchantment
is also damned.  Items preceded by a + are never damned and never have
negative enchatments.

All Chests, Bows, Polearms, Body armor, Staves are considered large.  All
other weapons and diggers weighing more than 15lbs are large.  All other items
are small.  Large items will not be dropped by monsters carrying 'small' items
and will not be found in chests.

When a range of charges or enchantments is given, the distribution in the game
is in the shape of a bell curve.  Therefore, the vast majority of items will be
in the middle of this range, and not at the ends.  For example:  An amulet of
searching has a range from -100 to +50, but both of these will be very rare.  
Much more common are amulets in the range -50 to +30 with values in the middle
generated quite often.

Note:  No generated item will have an enchantment of zero except for weapon 
+to hit, +to dam and armor +to AC

                                   ----------

Your chance to use a staff correctly relies on the following formula:

      +  INT bonus for devices (See INT table)
      -  Level of staff
      -  5

Spell System:

All player characters in Moria except warriors are able to cast some sort of
spells.  The types of spells are determined by your class.  Mage spells are
granted to Mages, Rangers, and Thieves, although only mages get all of the
spells.  Priest spells are granted to Priests and Paladins.

Each spell has four attributes to it:  Level, Mana, Failure, and Experience.
The Level of the spell is the level the caster needs to be to learn that spell.
Mana is the number of mana points it takes to attempt to cast the spell.
Failure is the base failure rate of the spell, and Experience is the number of
experience points the character receives for casting that spell successfully for
the first time.

The spells are divided up into eight books, four mage and four priest books.  
Here is the general table item table for spellbooks.

+---------------------------------------------------+
| Book                        | Type | Cost | Level |
+---------------------------------------------------+
| [Beginners-Magick]          | MAGE |   25 |   40  |
| [Beginners Handbook]        | CLER |   25 |   40  |
| [Magick I]                  | MAGE |  100 |   40  |
| [Words of Wisdom]           | CLER |  100 |   40  |
| [Magick II]                 | MAGE |  400 |   40  |
| [Chants and Blessings]      | CLER |  400 |   40  |
| [The Mages' Guide to Power] | MAGE |  800 |   40  |
| [Exorcism and Dispelling]   | CLER |  800 |   40  |
+--------------------------------------------------+

Mana:

Mana is granted depending on your intelligence, wisdom, and level.  Mage spells
require intelligence to cast successfully, and priest spells require wisdom.  The
formula for the number of Mana points a character has is:


        Level
      * Mana factor from INT/WIS
      + 1
     ---
        Mana

Level is the number of levels that character has been casting spells.  For
Priests, Paladins, and Mages, this is the same as their character level because
they get spells at first level.  Rangers would be level-2 because their first
spell is at third level, and Rogues would be level-4 for similar reasons.

Note:  A character with a factor of 0 (INT/WIS <8) will have 0 mana points and
not be able to cast any spells.

Failure:

All spells have at least a small chance of failing.  The formula below will
give the chance that a spell has of failing.

      + Base failure rate of spell
      + 3 * spell level
      - 3 * player level
      - INT/WIS fail adjust
      + 5 per mana point, if you don't have enough mana.
     ---
      Chance to fail.

Note:  The max failure rate is 95%, the lowest is 5%

--------------------------------| Wizard Mode |--------------------------------
                                ---------------

Entering Wizard Mode:

Do you really want to play in wizard mode?  Wizard mode is primarily used by
those who have just made a change in the source code of their copy of the game
and are testing it out.  Using wizard mode for 'fun' can degrade your
impression of the game, leading to 1) discontinued playing or 2) an inability
to play a game without cheating.  In addition, you cannot enter the high score
file after entering wizard mode.


What?  You're still here?

Ok.  To enter wizard mode, type ^W (That's control-W).  This will convert your
current character to a Wizard.

You can also invoke wizard mode at the command line by doing 'moria -w'.

If you want to resurrect a dead character, type moria -w (save file).  The
dungeon will be destroyed, and you'll return to the store level, but all of
your items will be intact.

Wizard Items:

Creation of Wizard items is usually used by real people to test new items
before inserting them into the wizard file.  For munchkins, this is used to
create godlike weapons.  You'll probably want the source code handy also.

There are several questions you must answer to create a new item:

Tval:  This is a group number that tells moria what kind of object the item is.

Just add up the flags you want and enter it as a hex number.



Cost:  The base cost in the stores (should you decide to sell it :-)

Level:  Level of the dungeon on which it would be randomly generated.  Wizard
items will not be randomly generated in the game.  Also affects the difficulty
of wand and staff use and recharging.
