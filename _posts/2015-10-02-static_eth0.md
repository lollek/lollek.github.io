title: Configure static eth0 in /etc/network/interfaces

## Description:
The first step is to establish basic network connectivity for your router/gateway.
This will allow you to connect to the installation server on the distribution network,
from which you can install the routing software needed in later steps.
Your router needs three network interfaces:

{% capture data %}
- the loopback interface (lo; which is used for network connections within the gateway)
- the interface connected to the distribution network (eth1)
- the interface connected to your network (eth0).

Each interface needs an address, netmask and broadcast address.
It is important that you specify the correct netmask and broadcast address!

D4-router.lab-2 expected configuration:

    lo   - loopback
    
    eth0 - internal network
      Network:    130.236.179.88/29
      IP-Address: 130.236.179.89
      Netmask:    255.255.255.248
      Broadcast:  130.236.179.95
    
    eth1 - external network
      Network:    130.236.178.0/26
      IP-Address: 130.236.178.33
      Netmask:    255.255.255.192
      Broadcast:  130.236.178.63
      Gateway:    130.236.178.1

## Implementation:

- Login to D4-router.lab-2 as root
- Copy /etc/network/interfaces to /etc/network/interfaces.change.0002
- Open /etc/network/interfaces in vi and add the following contents:

~~~
auto lo eth0 eth1

iface lo inet loopback

iface eth0 inet static
  address 130.236.179.89
  netmask 255.255.255.248
  broadcast 130.236.179.95

iface eth1 inet static
  address 130.236.178.33
  netmask 255.255.255.192
  broadcast 130.236.178.63
  gateway 130.236.178.1
~~~

Save file and run `ifup lo eth0 eth1`

## Verification:
- Should be able to ping 130.236.178.1 from D4-router.lab-2
- Restart router
- Should be able to ping 130.236.178.1 from D4-router.lab-2

## Backout:
