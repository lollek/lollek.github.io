# Rename multiple files

I have multiple directories with the following format:  
directory.name [word123]  
directory.name1 [word123]  
directory.name2 [word123]  
directory.name3 [word123]  
etc.  
I would like to remove the [word123] from each directory name. It is
unreasonable to perform a mv for each as there are simply too many!

{% highlight bash %}
for r in ./*\ \[word123\]; do mv "$r" "${r%\ \[word123\]}"; done
{% endhighlight %}

***
# Switch to a fake bash login-shell

{% highlight bash %}
exec -l bash           # If you're in bash:
bash -c 'exec -l bash' # If you're in another shell
{% endhighlight %}

***
# Fake running program name

{% highlight bash %}
(exec -a 'vim thesis.tex' nethack)
{% endhighlight %}

***
# Deleting file with unprintable characters

One example would be if you open vim and then type :w\^Z, where ^Z is created by
holding CTRL and clicking Z.

**1. Run ls -b to check their escaped name** (in my case this will be \032)

{% highlight bash %}
$ ls -b
\032  policy.rb  upp1.rb
{% endhighlight %}
**2. Let echo -e print out the name for you in your command**

{% highlight bash %}
rm $(echo -e "\032")
{% endhighlight %}
