SSH Config
----------
To make it easier to ssh (and enable autocomplete), create a ~/.ssh/config like
this:

{% highlight bash %}
Host *
  SendEnv LANG LC_*
  HashKnownHosts yes
  GSSAPIAuthentication yes
  PreferredAuthentications publickey,password
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
  ServerAliveInterval 60
  Compression      yes
  CompressionLevel 4
Host github
  Hostname github.com
  User git
{% endhighlight %}
and you will always use user git when you ssh to github

SSH Agent
---------
If you has a rsa-key and don't want to write in your credentials every time you ssh, you can use ssh-agent instead.
Add this to your .bash_profile (or make it a standalone script you execute once at startup)

{% highlight bash %}
SSHAGENT=$(command -v ssh-agent)
SSHAGENTARGS="-s"
if ! pgrep -xu $USER ssh-agent &>/dev/null; then
  if [[ -z "$SSH_AUTH_SOCK" && -x "$SSHAGENT" ]]; then
    eval "$($SSHAGENT $SSHAGENTARGS)"
    trap "kill $SSH_AGENT_PID" 0
  fi
fi
{% endhighlight %}

Then you add you credentials once by typing ssh-add (which will add ~/.ssh/id_rsa, you can also add others) and write in your password. Now ssh-agent will automatically provide the password for you for the duration of the session.

Easy ad-hoc SOCKS proxy
----------------------
Connect to a remote host with

{% highlight bash %}
ssh -fND 8080
{% endhighlight %}
and then point your browser to localhost:8080 to proxy through it
