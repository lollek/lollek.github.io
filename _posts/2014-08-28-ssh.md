If you has a rsa-key and don't want to write in your credentials every time you ssh, you can use ssh-agent instead.
Add this to your .bash_profile (or make it a standalone script you execute once at startup)

    SSHAGENT=$(command -v ssh-agent)
    SSHAGENTARGS="-s"
    if ! pgrep -xu $USER ssh-agent &>/dev/null; then
      if [[ -z "$SSH_AUTH_SOCK" && -x "$SSHAGENT" ]]; then
        eval "$($SSHAGENT $SSHAGENTARGS)"
        trap "kill $SSH_AGENT_PID" 0
      fi
    fi

Then you add you credentials once by typing ssh-add (which will add ~/.ssh/id_rsa, you can also add others) and write in your password. Now ssh-agent will automatically provide the password for you for the duration of the session.
