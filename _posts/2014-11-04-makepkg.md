## Before you start
1. Make sure you've configured [/etc/makepkg.conf](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Makepkg)
2. Download the package's PKGBUILD-file from AUR (under **View PKGBUILD** under **Package Actions** on the right side)

## Making
1. Put the PKGBUILD-file in a separate folder, maybe $HOME/tmp
2. cd to the folder
3. run makepkg -s
4. a) Does it want you to install any application? Press yes
4. b) Does it need some other package from AUR? Install that first
5. You should now have a pkg.tar.xz-file. Run pacman -U that.file.name.pkg.tar.xz
