[Chromium Issue #456222](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=456222)   
***Fix:***   
Chromium needs to be run with the flag *touch-devices=123*   
If you are running a DE, edit
**/usr/share/applications/chromium-browser.desktop**
and change the Exec-statement to
**Exec=chromium-browser %U --touch-devices=123**   
   
OR, you can disable mouse integration (Right-Ctrl + I)
