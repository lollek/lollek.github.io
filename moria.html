## General Tips
### Traps
Disarming traps give exp. But only do this if you are fine with the trap possibly springing on you, since sooner or later it will.

### Invisible monsters
A good way to kill invisible monsters is moving into a corridor, waiting until it
hits you, and then attacking the way you came from. If this doesn't work, it's one
of the ghosts which can walk through walls. It's usually better to just leave than
trying to kill those, since they don't chase much anyways.

### Farming with a wand of clone monster
- Pillardance like this. Only one monster can follow at a time. When you move to
  the middle of the pillar, the other monster will become stuck on the opposite
  side of the pillar  <pre>
    #............#
    #.n..........#
    #n##########.#
    #.@..........#
    ............##
    </pre>
- Kill it, then peek at the edge and the next monster will come. Clone and repeat

#### Good monsters to farm:  
- Gelatinous Cube (2d2 items, 90% chance of being treasure)
- Creeping Gold Coins (1d2 items, 90% chance of being treasure)
- Creeping Silver Coins (1d2 items, 60% chance of being treasure)
- (dangerous?) Guardian Naga (1d2 items, 60% chance of being treasure)
- (dangerous?) Vampire (1d2 items, 60% chance of being treasure)


## Playing a mage
### Starting out
- Learn *magic missle* at the start of the game, and use it as your main weapon.
- Always learn *phase door* and *teleport self* as quickly as possible. It's too
  late when you are surrounded by monsters.
- Never continue without full HP and mana.
- Save scrolls of *phase door* and *teleport*, since they have a 100% success
  rate. Use these when you have less than half HP, or out of mana.
- Don't learn spells such as healing and cure poison until you are dying and
  need them. You probably won't need to learn them at all.
- When possible, learn to create food magically. Carrying food is really heavy
  for a mage.
- Use m-a-f every time the screen moves, so you don't walk into traps.

### First mission, buying all mage books
Collect everything you can find on the levels and sell it to shopkeepers. Use
this money to purchase all the mage books. If the book you want to buy is out of
stock, it will appear again later. Sometimes you will lose books (especiallt to
those nasty hobbits), which makes getting them back the highest priority. One of
each book is fine unless you have really high strength and is fine with carrying
doubles.

### Second mission, get a permanent see-invisible item
You need some item to be able to see invisible enemies. Until you do this
you should not go past 950ft, since 1000-1200ft seem to spawn lots of new
invisible monsters which can drain your experience quickly. I did this by
clearing 900ft and 850ft and recalling afterwards to check the shop.
It is possible to dive to 50ft, wait 999 turns, then go up and check the
shop (which restocks every 1000 turns if you are not in town). This may
actually be better odds than normal adventuring, but it's too boring to be
worth it. In a worst (best?) case scenario, a Zweihander(HA) is worth
~13k, and shopkeepers usually have a 200% starting price tag, so you may
want to have between 20-30k ready. It's is easy to accidently insult the
shopkeeper enough to kick you out when buying these expensive items.
A good way of farming items is wands of clone monster and using them on
guardian nagas (which can be dangerous!) or gelatinous cubes (which are
not dangerous).  
The following items should provide see-invisible  

- Ring of See Invisible
- Amulet of the Magi
- Melee weapon (DF)
- Melee weapon (SU)
- Melee weapon (HA)

### Third mission, gain stats
You will need to max your strength, and hopefully your intelligence.
Go to 1250ft and clear it until you are happy. Try to farm monsters
with high drop rate if possible. 1200ft is much much worse for farming
stat potions so don't even try. 1300-1350ft should have an almost as good
drop-rate as 1250ft, but the new monsters, like disenchanter bat, may
make you regret trying.
